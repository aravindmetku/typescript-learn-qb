## Goal:
Learn to navigate and type enterprise source code using typescript

### Here's is what you are needed to to do:
All the files needed for exercise are present in the source code. This exercise is only for learning typescript. There is no need to run the Ts file unless you want to see the output in the console.
1. Review the index.ts file in your IDE
2. Typescript should be throwing an error. Fix the error by adding the correct type to  function in the file mentioned in index.ts
3. First exercise for _.find is already implemented. The intention is to understand the existing types, standards and use for other functions
